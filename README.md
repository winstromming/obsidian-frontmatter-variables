# Frontmatter Variables

Simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that defines a pattern (`{{variable}}`) which the plugin will parse from notes and replace with the value of any frontmatter property with the same name in Reading View.

## Usage Examples

Suppose your note has the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
year: 1975
price: 7.50
firstname: Oscar
lastname: Wilde
parents: ["[[William]]", "[[Jane]]"]
friends: ["Alice", "Bob"]
colleagues: ["Carol", "Dave"]
scores: [10, 20, 15]
---
```

You can use the following patterns in your note:

```yaml
{{ year }}
→ 1975

{{ price }}
→ 7.5

{{ firstname }}
→ Oscar

{{ parents }}
→ William (as internal link)
  Jane (as internal link)

{{ firstname + lastname }}
→ OscarWilde

{{ upper(firstname) }}
→ OSCAR

{{ lower(lastname) }}
→ wilde

{{ first(firstname) + last(lastname) }}
→ Oe

{{ highest(firstname) }}
→ srOca

{{ lowest(firstname) - ac }}
→ Ors

{{ join(friends, colleagues) }}
→ Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave

{{ upper(friends - Bob) }}
→ ALICE

{{ size(friends, colleagues) }}
→ 4

{{ first(friends, colleagues) }}
→ Alice

{{ last(friends, colleagues) }}
→ Dave

{{ join(highest(scores)) }}
→ 20, 15, 10

{{ join(lowest(scores, 5, 25)) }}
→ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25

{{ first(highest(scores)) }}
→ 20

{{ first(lowest(scores)) }}
→ 10

{{ first(year) }}
→ 1

{{ last(year) }}
→ 5

{{ size(price) }}
→ 3

{{ last(year) + first(price) }}
→ 12

{{ highest(year) }}
→ 9751

{{ lowest(year) }}
→ 1579

{{ upper(price) }}
→ 8

{{ lower(price) }}
→ 7

{{ upper(firstname, friends, colleagues, lastname) }}
→ OSCAR
  ALICE
  BOB
  CAROL
  DAVE
  WILDE

{{ lower(firstname + lastname) + year }}
→ oscarwilde1975
```

### Prefix display

If you want the variable name as a bold prefix, use `!` before the variable:

```yaml
{{ !price }}
→ <b>Price:</b> 7.50

{{ !friends }}
→ <b>Friends:</b>
  Alice
  Bob
```
