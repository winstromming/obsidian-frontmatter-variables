# Frontmatter Variables

Simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that defines a pattern (`{{variable}}`) which the plugin will parse from notes replace with the value of any frontmatter property with the same name in Reading View.

> **Note:** This plugin does not modify the source markdown, only how it's shown in the Reading view, meaning it won't work on pages generated by Obsidian Publish.

## Output

You can use the `!` prefix if you want the property name prefixing the value. You can use the `...` suffix if you want list items to be concatenated into one line instead of given one line each. You can combine both. Wiki-links will always be convered to actual links.

```yml
---
foo: Hello
bar:
  - a
  - b
  - c
etc: "[[Note]]"
---

{{ foo }}     // Hello
{{ !foo }}    // <b>Foo:</b> Hello
{{ bar }}     // a<br />b<br />c
{{ bar... }}  // a, b, c
{{ !bar... }} // <b>Bar:</b> a, b, c
{{ etc }}     // <a href="Note.md">Note</a>
```

## Operations

You can perform very simple operations on values with `+` or `-`. If the properties are numbers, they will be added or subtracted. If the properties are strings, they will either be joined by a space or removed. If any property is a list, they will all be concatenated into one list.

```yml
---
age: 25
year: 2025
name: Oscar
item: car
food:
  - fruit
  - bread
---

{{ age + year }}       // 2050
{{ name + item }}      // Oscar car
{{ name - item }}      // Os
{{ item + food ... }}  // car, fruit, bread
```

You can include refrences to properties that don't exist. In which case, they will either be treated as numbers or strings depending on context.

```yml
---
age: 25
item: Apple iPhone
---

{{ age + 5 }}          // 30
{{ age + years old }}  // 25 years old
{{ item - Apple }}     // iPhone
```
