# Frontmatter Variables

Simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that defines a pattern (`{{variable}}`) which the plugin will parse from notes replace with the value of any frontmatter property with the same name in Reading View.

-   Serialises lists into a comma-separated lines of text.
-   Generates working links from any wiki-link values.

> **Note:** This plugin does not modify the source markdown, only how it's shown in the Reading view, meaning it won't work on pages generated by Obsidian Publish.
